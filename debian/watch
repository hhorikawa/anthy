# The previous upstream
#      https://osdn.net/projects/anthy/
# had the last release anthy-9100 anthy-9100h (Date: 2009-02-09)
# It hasn't been updated since then.
#
# Debian accumulated many patches.
#
# On Tue, 28 Apr 2015, Debian maintainer lead by 
# NIIBE Yutaka <gniibe@fsij.org> took over its maintenance and started to act
# as upstream with upstream-branch=release on alioth git repo.
#
# Osamu Aoki moved this git repository to salsa after closing of the alioth
# service.
#
# Thus watch file is irrelevant now.
